### About me

My name is Alexey Fedorov, and I am a full-time software engineer. I graduated in 2017 with a master’s degree in Power System Automation from Chuvash State University.

I worked as an electrical power engineer for 3 years before decided to complitely change my career and become a software engineer. I started as a Desktop Developer and now as a Backend Developer. I mainly use C# and ASP.NET, but I also work with TypeScript and React.

I speak Russian and English and am currently learning Serbian.

### About this blog

I enjoy learning about .NET internals, analyzing and improving code performance, and working with algorithms and data structures. In this blog, I share tips and explain C# development, with a focus on making code faster.

I’m always learning. If you think I’ve missed something or made a mistake, please leave a comment or send me a message.
