### About me

My name is Alexey Fedorov, a software engineer with a master's degree in Power System Automation from Chuvash State University, earned in 2017.

After working as an electrical power engineer for three years, I decided to completely change my career and become a software engineer. Starting as a desktop developer, I now specialize in backend development, mainly using C# and ASP.NET, but also working with TypeScript and React.

Since 2022, I’ve been living in Serbia. I’m fluent in Russian and English, and currently learning Serbian.

### About this blog

I enjoy learning about .NET internals, analyzing and improving code performance, and working with algorithms and data structures. In this blog, I share tips and explain C# development, with a focus on making code faster. From time to time, I also post about life in emigration.

New posts are typically published weekly, but it depends on the article complexity.

I’m always learning. If you think I’ve missed something or made a mistake, please leave a comment or send me a message.
